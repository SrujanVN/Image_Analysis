Image Convolution and Edge Detection with Sobel Operators
This project demonstrates image processing using Sobel operators for edge detection. The Sobel operator highlights regions with high spatial frequency, which often correspond to edges or boundaries in an image, making it an essential tool in image processing for tasks like object recognition, image segmentation, and contour detection.

Overview
The notebook in this project focuses on:

Loading an Image: Reading an image in grayscale format for processing.
Applying Sobel Filters: Using the Sobel operator in both the horizontal and vertical directions to detect edges.
Combining Gradients: Calculating the combined gradient magnitude to obtain the final edge-detected image.
The Sobel operator is used here due to its simplicity and efficiency in edge detection, providing detailed information about edges by detecting both horizontal and vertical gradients.

Requirements
To run the code, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python
Project Structure
The main sections of the notebook include:

Introduction: Explanation of Sobel filtering and edge detection concepts.
Image Loading: Code to load and display the target image.
Sobel Filter Application: Code to apply Sobel filters in both x and y directions.
Gradient Combination: Code to combine gradients from both directions to generate a final edge-detected image.
Usage
Load an Image: First, load an image in grayscale. This step is essential as the Sobel operator works best on single-channel (grayscale) images.

python
Copy code
import cv2
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
Apply the Sobel Filter: Use the Sobel operator to detect edges in the x and y directions. The kernels detect vertical and horizontal changes in intensity, respectively.

python
Copy code
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)  # Sobel X for horizontal edges
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)  # Sobel Y for vertical edges
Combine the Results: Calculate the magnitude of the gradient to form the combined edge image.

python
Copy code
sobel_combined = cv2.magnitude(sobel_x, sobel_y)
Display the Results (Optional): You can display the original and processed images using OpenCV or Matplotlib.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1), plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original Image'), plt.axis('off')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2), plt.imshow(sobel_combined, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Edge Detected Image'), plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
Example Output
The result of applying the Sobel operation will be an image highlighting edges, with high-gradient regions representing edges or contours of objects within the original image.

Explanation of Sobel Operators
Sobel X Kernel
The Sobel operator in the x direction uses a convolutional kernel to detect vertical edges:

Sobel X
=
[
−

]
Sobel X=

Sobel Y Kernel
The Sobel operator in the y direction uses a different kernel for detecting horizontal edges:

Sobel Y
=
[
−

Combining Gradients
The horizontal and vertical gradients are combined to obtain the overall gradient magnitude:

Gradient Magnitude=

This combined image provides a high-contrast outline of object boundaries.
